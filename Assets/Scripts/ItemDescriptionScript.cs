        {"Back Panel", "This open frame inverter is 50% quieter and 20% lighter than a traditional 3500-watt portable generator. We cut the noise level in half by integrating Quiet Technology digital inverter components. Then, we created an efficient mechanical design to decrease the overall footprint and weight by 20 percent." },
        {"battery", "With a 0.6-quart oil capacity (recommended 10W-30) and a low oil shut-off sensor, this inverter operates at 64 dBA from 23 feet, which is a bit louder than normal speech"},
        {"Cable", "All the outlets have covers for protection and include a 120V 30A (TT-30R) RV outlet as well as a 120/240V 30A locking outlet (L14-30R) and two 120V 20A household outlets (5-20R)."},

        {"Front.Panel", "Our Quick Touch Panel offers fast access to controls, while Economy Mode monitors power consumption in real time to reduce electrical load. As the electrical load is reduced, the engine idles lower, providing quieter operation, extended engine life and higher fuel economy."},
        {"Oil Tank", "With a 0.6-quart oil capacity (recommended 10W-30) and a low oil shut-off sensor, this inverter operates at 64 dBA from 23 feet, which is a bit louder than normal speech."},

        {"Radiator", "The optional Parallel Kit, with included standard 50-amp RV outlet, provides a clip-on connection which allows you to increase output by connecting up to two 2800-watt or higher inverters or or open frame inverters."},
        {"Rama", "50% quieter and 20% lighter than a traditional Champion 3500-watt generator, plus our Economy Mode feature saves fuel and extends engine life"},
        {"Top Container", "The optional Parallel Kit, with included standard 50-amp RV outlet, provides a clip-on connection which allows you to increase output by connecting up to two 2800-watt or higher inverters or or open frame inverters."}
