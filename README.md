<h1>Unity WebGL demo project assets to demonstrate compilled project online</h1>
<p/>
<div>
It is a simple project. It has two scenes and one model exported from Blender. Model consists of several parts and I animated them. I used both types of animation - in Unity builder (color animation) and in script (positions animation). The project also has very simple UI - panels and text (also animated) and buttons. Selected gameobject can be sent from one scene to another. I used Coroutines for smooth camera animation and object animmations.
Here is a link to the compiled  webgl application. I posted it on free service pythonanywhere.com - I created a one page website using python and Flask.
